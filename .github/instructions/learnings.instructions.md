# Learnings

Durable rules discovered the hard way. Keep each to 1-4 sentences. If a learning
grows into a procedure, promote it to a skill and leave a pointer here.

## Editing

- **Edit large shared files atomically via bash, not the `edit`/`create` tools.**
  On big files that take several seconds to write - `index.html`,
  `page-shell.js` - the `edit`/`create` tools can be interrupted mid-write when a
  new user message arrives, leaving a half-written file and a stuck-looking
  agent. For those, prefer one atomic `python3` heredoc that string-replaces with
  a uniqueness guard (`assert s.count(old) == 1`), or a `cat > file <<'EOF'`
  full-file write with the delimiter quoted so the shell does not expand the body.
  Small, quick files are fine with the normal tools.

## Course structure

- **Card counts and the next-lesson button are data-driven - do not hand-maintain
  them.** `index.html`'s per-track count reads the `.c-card` elements, and
  `page-shell.js` derives `awardedKey`/`nextHref` from the filename plus the
  `PRACTICAL`/`THEORY` arrays. When you add a lesson you only add its card and its
  filename to the right `page-shell.js` array (in reading order); never bump a
  count by hand, and never set `awardedKey`/`nextHref` in a lesson data file.
